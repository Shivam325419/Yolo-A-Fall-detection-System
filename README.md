The Varishta Rakshak project is an innovative AI-based system designed to ensure the safety and well-being of senior citizens through real-time monitoring and fall detection. Leveraging advanced AI technology like YOLO, it continuously tracks movements to detect falls or emergencies as they happen. Upon detecting a potential issue, the system promptly sends automated alerts to emergency contacts via email and SMS, using the Gmail API and Twilio Messaging API. This ensures immediate assistance can be provided, reducing risks associated with delayed responses. Built using Python, OpenCV, and Firebase, the system offers a reliable and efficient solution for round-the-clock monitoring, making it a valuable tool for families and caregivers seeking to enhance the safety of their elderly loved ones.

The Varishta Rakshak project is an AI-based model focused on real-time senior citizen care. Key aspects include:

Fall Detection: Utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for advanced real-time fall detection using AI.

Emergency Alerts: Integrated an automated system to notify emergency contacts promptly in case of detected falls or emergencies.

User Monitoring: Enabled continuous monitoring to ensure the safety of senior citizens.

APIs Used:
Gmail API: For email notifications.

Twilio Messaging API: For sending SMS alerts.
